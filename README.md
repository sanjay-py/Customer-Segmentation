# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **unsupervised machine learning** to segment mall customers based on their **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing and business strategy planning.

## 📌 Key Objectives
- Understand customer demographics and spending behavior.
- Visualize key insights through histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- Use **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers into meaningful groups.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**, **Silhouette Score**, and **PCA**.
- Visualize clusters using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for better interpretability.

## 📂 Features
- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Summary Statistics
- ✅ Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- ✅ Gender distribution analysis using bar and pie charts
- ✅ Histograms and boxplots for Age, Income, and Spending Score
- ✅ K-Means Clustering with multiple cluster evaluation techniques
- ✅ PCA for dimensionality reduction and cluster visualization
- ✅ Interactive visualizations using Plotly

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which includes:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- scikit-learn (KMeans, Silhouette Score, PCA)
- yellowbrick (for Elbow & Silhouette visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the script or Jupyter notebook to perform analysis and view visualizations.

## 📌 Output
- Cluster visualizations based on Spending Score vs Income and Age.
- PCA-based customer segmentation.
- Insights into customer behavior by segment.
